# nvda2speechd Python Server Implementation

## Overview

This project includes a Python implementation of the [nvda2speechd](https://github.com/RastislavKish/nvda2speechd) server. This version is intended to be more comprehensive, easier to develop and maintain, and potentially include additional future improvements.

## Setup Instructions

Follow these steps to set this project up:

1. **Install pipenv:** This can be done using pipx or your Linux distribution's package manager.

2. **Navigate to this repository:** This can be done with the `cd` command.

3. **Install dependencies with pipenv:** Run the command `pipenv install`.

4. **Get Python path:** Run `pipenv run which python` and note down the resulting path. The path should resemble `/home/user/.local/share/virtualenvs/nvda2speechd-python-server-LHzG5Lrx/bin/python`. Remove `/bin/python` from the path and remember the reduced path, for example `/home/user/.local/share/virtualenvs/nvda2speechd-python-server-LHzG5Lrx/`.

5. **link the Python speechd module:** Run the command `ln -s /usr/lib/python3.11/site-packages/speechd <path>/lib/python3.11/site-packages/`, replacing `<path>` with the one noted down in step 4.

## Usage Instructions

Once you have completed the setup, simply run `pipenv run python server.py` to start the server.
